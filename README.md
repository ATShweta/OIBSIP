# OIBSIP - Oasis Infobyte Data Analytics Internship

This repository showcases tasks and projects completed during my Data Analytics internship at Oasis Infobyte. It highlights my practical experience and skills developed throughout the internship.

## Projects/Tasks - 

## Level 1

### <b> Task 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales Data </b>
This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a retail sales dataset to uncover insights regarding sales trends, customer demographics, and product purchasing behavior. The analysis utilizes various data visualization techniques to present findings and provides actionable recommendations for improving sales performance.

### <b> Task 2 - Customer Segmentation Analysis </b>
This project aims to perform customer segmentation analysis for an e-commerce company. By analyzing customer behavior and purchase patterns, the goal is to group customers into distinct segments. This segmentation can inform targeted marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall business strategies.

### <b> Task 3 - Cleaning Data </b>
This project demonstrates data cleaning techniques on a real-world dataset to ensure data quality for analysis and model building. Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data science workflow, as it helps to improve the reliability and accuracy of results.
<br/><b> Goal </b> - Data Integrity, Handling Missing Data, Removing duplicates, Outlier Detection and Handling, Standardization

### <b> Task 4 - Sentiment Analysis </b>
The goal of this project is to develop a sentiment analysis model that classifies text data into **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative** sentiments. By analyzing text from various sources, this model can provide valuable insights into public opinion, customer feedback, and social media trends.


## Level 2

### <b> Task 5 - House Price Prediction with Linear Regression </b>
The objective of this project is to develop a regression model to predict house prices based on various factors such as area, number of bedrooms, presence of air conditioning, and other house features. Linear regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm, is used in this project to provide a clear interpretation of the relationships between features and house prices.

### <b> Task 6 - Wine Quality Prediction </b>
The objective of this project is to predict wine quality based on its chemical properties using machine learning models, enabling insights into which attributes most influence quality. This approach aids in improving quality control and assessment in viticulture.
